Work smarter, not harder. Frameworks, namely Semantic UI, are perfect examples of working smarter. Although there may be a learning curve associated with learning these frameworks, its versatility and utility far outweigh the time invested in learning it. One of the most important features of Semantic UI is that it simplifies any user-interface elements in a webpage due to the framework’s support for features such as drop-down menus. With Semantic UI’s numerous classes and CSS styles, developers are provided with an endless array of customization for their page elements. Using these frameworks effectively can lead to visually pleasing and overall, higher quality code.
In other words, frameworks offer pre-built libraries for different components in a webpage. Why reinvent the wheel? Frameworks reduce the need for complicated HTML and CSS code, as many developer-desired features are already embedded into the class definitions. Their straightforward syntax and class definitions make it trivial for developers to implement new features on their webpages. Other benefits from using a framework include writing less CSS code and more structured HTML code. In the bigger picture, these minor but convenient features enable developers to use their time for efficiently. For example, centering images or other elements on a webpage can be done easily through Semantic UI by declaring the desired class as “ui centered image” or any other class with “centered” in the definition. This cuts down on time spent adjusting minor aspects on a webpage such as margin or padding pixels. As a result, developers have more time to work on less trifling things on their webpage.
Personally, I struggled with picking up Semantic UI initially because I did not know the syntax. However, after reading up on the documentation, creating UI classes became increasingly easier the more I used them. Overall, Semantic UI has proved to be a convenient and effective tool to learn due to its versatility and ease-of-use. In addition, its abundant documentation is also a tremendous help whenever I get stuck on an issue. Semantic UI and other frameworks are essential to creating extravagant, yet simple webpages. The sheet magnitude of customization is unparalleled, allowing developers to let their minds run wild when designing webpages. It’s a no-brainer to use available resources for boosting work efficiency, but more importantly, to work smarter.
