Itâ€™s the little things that matter the most. Properly formatted code is a beauty to marvel at. Minor details in code formatting are eye catching for those who have attention to detail. These coding standards help to clean up code and present it in a way that is consistent and visually pleasing. Additionally, they have a significant impact on productivity in various development environments including IntelliJ. Although it can sometimes be cumbersome, ESLint is an effective tool to use as it enforces strict code formatting. Standardizing code structure and style is especially important in large-scale team code development because it enables different coding styles to be reshaped into a cookie-cutter format. By doing so, it expedites the learning curve when code is handed off to another developer.

Configuring ESLint to work with IntelliJ was confusing at first due to all the settings that needed to be changed. However, after some trial and error, this tool enabled me to consistently write code that satisfied the ESLint formatting guidelines by raising errors that I normally would have overlooked. It also pointed out the flaws in my coding style which can be attributed to muscle memory. Although it initially was troublesome to format my code to the green checkmark standard, this challenge has become increasingly easier as I gained more experience developing code which adhered to these standards. Slowly but surely, I am becoming more conscious of how I name my variables, the spaces I put within functions, and many more minor details.

Despite these initial obstacles, I have come to realize that ESLint and proper coding standards increase code readability, maintainability, and lead to higher quality code overall. Having a standard enables the development of consistent and higher quality code. Furthermore, it boosts productivity as it lessens the amount of time needed by a software developer to check code structure. ESLint is essentially a second compiler which is focused on code style. Therefore, it is essential for aspiring and current software developers to add this linter to their toolset.
