summary: My team developed a web application for UH Manoa students to connect with potential roommates and find off campus housing around the island of Oahu.
---

### Project Overview
Hale Manoa was designed with the intention of helping UH Manoa students find compatible roommates and suitable off campus housing options. Through this web application, users will be able to search among the site's database of registered users for others who share similar interests and are also looking for housing. They will also be able to view the various available listings posted by other users. With Hale  Manoa, students will have a centralized platform for finding a suitable housing option and meeting potential roommates.

### Contributions to Project
I was responsible for the connect page which displayed all the users in cards, the user profile page, and implementing the filtering interface for the connect and housing pages. I was also in charge of the conditional renders on the housing and profile pages. Certain functionality such as adding a house listing were restricted to specfic user types.

### Learning Outcomes
Working on this project helped to expand my knowledge of the React framework, HTML and CSS programmming practices for styling, and with Meteor. Because this project was team-based, I was able to learn about the issue, milestone, and project features within Github for task designation and organization. Through this project, I feel that my software development and project management skills have been further refined.
